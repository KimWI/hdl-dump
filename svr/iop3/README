The new hdld_svr.elf README
===========================

What's all this about?
----------------------

The new server uses UDP, instead of TCP. Because UDP is unreliable,
now and then client asks the server if there is a need to retransmit
any part of the data.

Basically, protocol works as follows: client tells the server
"I'm want to write # sectors, starting at #"; then it starts to flood
the server with data via UDP. If client sends the data too fast
server cannot "consume" it, hence the data gets lost and should be
retransmitted. If client sends the data too slow, you loose speed.
For not to drown server the client sends a small number of packets
then sleeps for a tiny amount of time. Number of packets and time
to sleep are controlable via configuration file. On Windows time
is in milliseconds, whereas on Unix is in microseconds (1000 times
less). hdl_dump client comes with a reasonable defaults, but you
can change those numbers (with some limits).

It should be clear already, that the new server is not compatible with
older servers, therefore server port has been changed.


HOWTO setup environment
-----------------------

Copy all files in the following location:
	hdl_dump/svr/iop3/
Open term, navigate to the same location, execute assemble.sh

You need Subversion client, wget and Internet connection in order
to succeed.

When script completes, use the following commands to build
the alternative IOP module:
	cd tcpip/
	make
	ls -l bin/


HOWTO build loader
------------------

Copy new ps2iop.irx on top of the old one:
	cd hdl_dump/svr/irx
	mv ps2ip.irx ps2ip_orig.irx
	cd ../iop2/
	cp tcpip/bin/ps2ip.irx ../irx/

Patch hdl_dump/svr/ee/loader.c:82 - comment-out the line
	#define LOAD_SERVER

Build the new loader:
	cd hdl_dump/svr
	make clean
	make
