Intro
-----

Latest version, as well as some? documentation (ha-ha-ha) is to be
found on the new official repository -- https://bitbucket.org/AKuHAK/hdl-dump/.
Me reads w1zard0f07@yahoo.com and ps2-scene forums every now and then.
Easy guide for installing games can be found here --

Networking server
-----------------

A new, purely UDP networking server is available, based on recently
released on psx-scene forums smap driver
(http://ichiba.geocities.jp/ysai187/PS2/smap.htm). 

You might need
to punch a hole in your firewall for incoming UDP from port 12345.

Compilation
-----------
You just can run shell script in the project folder: "mkrel.sh". It will
compile both gui and normal version for windows.

* Linux: Build and copy executable into a directory of your choice.
	make RELEASE=yes
Advanced Linux build commands:
	make XC=win          # for Windows cross-compilation using mingw32
	make -C gui          # for WineLib compilation
	make -C gui XC=win   # for GUI cross-compilation using mingw32

* FreeBSD and MacOS X: You'll need to have GNU make installed, then
	gmake RELEASE=yes IIN_OPTICAL_MMAP=no
or
	make RELEASE=yes IIN_OPTICAL_MMAP=no

* Windows: You need to have CYGWIN (http://www.cygwin.com/) installed;
then use
	make RELEASE=yes
	make -C gui RELEASE=yes
to compile command-line or GUI version.

NOTICE: with current compilation flags hdl_dump would not handle
correctly Ctrl+C if ran from-within a CYGWIN shell. AFAIR, removing
"-mno-cygwin" might correct this behaviour, but will break Ctrl+C
handling when ran from a Command Prompt.



Configuration and list file location
------------------------------------

You can place this files in folder where is installed hdl_dump for
making it portable.

* Windows: (cited names are for English version of Windows)
C:\Documents and Settings\<login name>\Application Data\hdl_dump.conf
C:\Documents and Settings\<login name>\Application Data\hdl_dump.list

* Linux, FreeBSD and MacOS X: (~ is your home dir)
~/.hdl_dump.conf
~/.hdl_dump.list


Configuration
-------------

* disc_database_file -- full path to your disc compatibility database
file;


New features
-----

All new stuffs can be used from HDD_OSD or BB Navigator.

inject_dvd, inject_cd, install or copy_hdd.

The only thing you need - you have to place boot.elf (which is actually
miniopl.elf) and list.ico (*.ico from memory card) in the folder where is
launched from hdl_dump. This command will install game onto hard disk. Be
careful if you choose command copy_hdd - every HDL game will loose their
icons and will use only one for all (the same for kelf).
boot.elf - you can use everything but I prefer miniopl. Miniopl allows you
to launch titles from HDD OSD or BB NAV by pressing on title.
boot.elf injection address - 0x111000
boot.elf size limit - 732 160 bytes (restricted due to free KELF poc size)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
initialize

When you use this command and place hard drive into your playstation 2 phat
and power it on - it will launch mbr. So it can be used as Free MC Boot
replacement (no need for memory card or modchip for lauching homebrews).

In previous version this command tried to install one __mbr partition - but
there was a bug in the code so this command won't work correctly. I decide to
remove it at all and replace with MBR injection. All that you need - place
MBR.KELF in the corresponding folder. All HDD data will remain intact!!!!!

MBR.KELF injection address - 0x404000 (for compatibility with BB Nav)
MBR.KELF doesn't have any restrictions by themself.
There is no easy way to make MBR.KELFS from common elf.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
modify_header
Code:
hdl_dump.exe modify_header 192.168.0.10 PP.TEST

This command will inject header attributes in any already existing partition.
It can operate such files:
system.cnf
icon.sys
list.ico
del.ico
boot.kelf
boot.elf
boot.kirx
Any file can be skipped. Program first of all tries to inject boot.kelf. 
If it is not found it will try to inject boot.elf.

del.ico injection address: 0x041000
If del.ico is used list.ico maximum size 260 096bytes.
boot.elf (or boot.kelf) injection address - 0x111000
boot.elf size limit - 732 160 bytes (restricted due to free KELF poc size)
boot.kelf size limit - 3 076 096 bytes (if boot.kirx not used)
boot.kelf size limit - 2 031 616 bytes (if boot.kirx is used)
boot.kirx injection address - 0x301000
boot.kirx size limit - 1 044 480 bytes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to know much about these files (and their restrictions) you have to study official ps2sdk document called hdd_rule_3.0.2.pdf.

There is also some undocumented features like this:
- If you want to inject boot.kelf (or boot.elf) you have to change BOOT2 in system.cnf: 
Code:
|-----------------|
| BOOT2 = PATINFO |
|-----------------|
This is used for HDL games for example.

-If you want to launch KELF from PFS partition you have to change BOOT2 in system.cnf: 
Code:
|---------------------------|
| BOOT2 = pfs:/EXECUTE.KELF |
|---------------------------|
where EXECUTE.KELF - is path to KELF which is placed into partition. Can be changed.

-If you want to inject kirx into partition you have to add such a line into system.cnf 
Code:
|-----------------|
| IOPRP = PATINFO |
|-----------------|
Don't ask me about kirx - I don't know where it can be used.

-If you don't want to boot from HDD OSD or BB Nav you have to add such a line into system.cnf 
|----------------|
| BOOT2 = NOBOOT |
|----------------|

Happy gaming.
