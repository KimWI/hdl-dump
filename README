Latest version, as well as some? documentation (ha-ha-ha) is to be
found on the official site -- http://www.psx-scene.com/hdldump/.
Me reads w1zard0f07@yahoo.com and ps2-scene forums every now and then.


Networking server
-----------------

A new, purely UDP networking server is available, based on recently
released on psx-scene forums smap driver
(http://ichiba.geocities.jp/ysai187/PS2/smap.htm). 

You might need
to punch a hole in your firewall for incoming UDP from port 12345.

Compilation
-----------
You just can run shell script in the project folder: "mkrel.sh". It will
compile both gui and normal version for windows.

* Linux: Build and copy executable into a directory of your choice.
	make RELEASE=yes
Advanced Linux build commands:
	make XC=win          # for Windows cross-compilation using mingw32
	make -C gui          # for WineLib compilation
	make -C gui XC=win   # for GUI cross-compilation using mingw32

* FreeBSD and MacOS X: You'll need to have GNU make installed, then
	gmake RELEASE=yes IIN_OPTICAL_MMAP=no
or
	make RELEASE=yes IIN_OPTICAL_MMAP=no

* Windows: You need to have CYGWIN (http://www.cygwin.com/) installed;
then use
	make RELEASE=yes
	make -C gui RELEASE=yes
to compile command-line or GUI version.

NOTICE: with current compilation flags hdl_dump would not handle
correctly Ctrl+C if ran from-within a CYGWIN shell. AFAIR, removing
"-mno-cygwin" might correct this behaviour, but will break Ctrl+C
handling when ran from a Command Prompt.



Configuration and list file location
------------------------------------

* Windows: (cited names are for English version of Windows)
C:\Documents and Settings\<login name>\Application Data\hdl_dump.conf
C:\Documents and Settings\<login name>\Application Data\hdl_dump.list

* Linux, FreeBSD and MacOS X: (~ is your home dir)
~/.hdl_dump.conf
~/.hdl_dump.list


Configuration
-------------

* disc_database_file -- full path to your disc compatibility database
file;


Happy gaming.
